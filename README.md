Live PaintR
===========
by Jeremy Casey, 2013-08-28

A simple drawing canvas web app, made using .Net and SignalR. Anything you draw on the canvas is broadcast to all connected users in real time. It's just a quick practice app I made while learning SignalR at the Toronto .Net Hackers Meet Up.

NOTE: Pen colour selection is only supported in chrome.
